# ISA-616-Final-Project
Welcome to our repository for our ISA 616 Final Project. For this project, we aim to help our client (the ISA department) reclassify their students to determine incoming pipeline numbers to determine when a student is about to graduate.

Here is a list of the relevant files you will find in this repository:
1. FinalProject.Rmd - This is the primary final our group used to conduct our analyses in R following our data cleaning step. In addition, you will find our team's problem statement, research questions, BVP, and timeline for completion.
2. BAStudent_Cleaning.Rmd - This file contains the relevant cleaning our group did to clean the files that relate to Business Analytics Students
3. ISStudent_Cleaning.Rmd - This file contains the relevant cleaning our group did to clean the files that related to Information Systems Students
4. 616FinalProjectCleaning.Rmd - This file combines both the BA student cleaning and IS student cleaning files to clean each data set and then merge the datasets together.
5. FinalProject.html - This is the file that was ultimately submitted to the ISA department as the main deliverable for this project.

All of the data that we used for this project is housed in the initial-data and the data-clean folders. The initial-data folder contains all of the raw data before it was processed through data cleaning in R. The data-clean folder contains all of the cleaned data after it was processed through R.
