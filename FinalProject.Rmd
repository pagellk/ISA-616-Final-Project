# Problem Statement
The ISA department has multiple classes of students each year. However, each year the number of graduate students donâ€™t align with the number of students in the major the previous year. We have been asked to research the data and understand where these students are going, what are the leading causes of students leaving, and to redesign the classification metrics for grade level. The data also needs to be restructured into a more understandable format that can be used to better predict graduation rates each year.

# Research Questions
* Why are there fewer graduating seniors than estimated each year, and what is the cause for this drop-off?
  * Where are these students going?
* What is the best way to classify student grade levels?
* Are there indicators that can show when we estimate a student is about to graduate?

## Customer Jobs

Our client for this project is the Information Systems and Analytics department at Miami, but more specifically, Dr. Benamati and Dr. Farmer. These two have a very important role in the ISA department to monitor the health of the organization and to appropriate allocate resources based on needs.

### Monitor the Overall Health of the Information Systems and Analytics Department as it Pertains to Departmental Entrollment

As the chairs of the department, Dr. Benamati and Dr. Farmer are tasked with monitoring the overall health and performance of the Information Systems and Analytics department. This can include monitoring departmental enrollment as it pertains to showing the amount of students who enter into ISA majors as freshmen, retention within the department, and ultimately, how many students graduate with a degree from the department. This health ultimately helps Dr. Benamati and Dr. Farmer argue for the case of the ISA department during the State of the Department and can help the department grow over time.

### Allocate Resources Appropriately Depending on the Size and Performance of the Department

Based on the health that is monitored from the department, Dr. Benamati and Dr. Farmer are tasked with allocating resources appropriately. This can include increasing the number of professors or course sections offered depending on the amount of ISA majors that are enrolled. 

## Customer Pains

### Lack of Clarity of BA/ISA Student Grade Classification and Expected Graduating Students
Student classification of grades has led to inaccurate data regarding the number of expected graduates. 

### Difficulty Understanding Departmental Enrollment
Due to misclassifications and other factors, there are inaccuracies that misrepresent the true enrollment of the ISA department

### Unclear Presentation of Data
The current table that is used to present enrollment data can be confusing and inaccurate.

## Customer Gains

### Be Able to Understand How Students are Classified as Freshmen, Sophomores, etc. in the Data Set
With the current data set, the current classification of grades has led to inaccurate data reporting when it comes to anticipating the number of graduates within the data set.

### Better Understand what Factors May Influence Departmental Enrollment in the ISA Department as Well as Where they Go if they Change their Major
Within the current data set, there is no way to estimate when a student is about to exit the ISA department, whether that be because they are about to graduate or because they are changing their major. Thus, it makes it difficult for the ISA department to allocate their resources to maximize student benefit.

## Products and Services

### Providing a New Classification Metric for Grade Level of Students (Freshman, Sophomore, etc.)
Take more factors into account to better determine expected graduation of students. Current method of classification by number of credit hours does not best reflect student year and expected graduation.

### Providing Insight for Departmental Enrollment Numbers and Graduation Rates
Better indicate when a student is about to graduate from the ISA department so that resources can be allocated effectively.

### Providing a More Informative Presentation of Department Enrollment Numbers
The current matrix visual within the State of the Department Presentation can be hard for a non-analytical audience to read to understand the enrollment numbers problem easily.

## Pain Relievers

### Accurate Grade Classification that Reflects Expected Graduation
With the current state of the data, the actual number of graduating seniors is less than the anticipated amount in the previous year. Through our work, we seek to relieve this pain to account for anticipated early graduations, transfers, etc. We also seek to find a better way to classify student grades rather than solely by number of credit hours taken.

### Greater Insights Into True Enrollment Numbers for the ISA Department
Through our solution, we will provide the ISA department with a more accurate reporting for the ISA department so that they are able to allocate resources and budget effectively for the upcoming year.

### Clear Presentation of the State of the Department
Through our solution, we will prepare a more effective presentation of the ISA department's numbers in the State of the Department presentation. This information will be well organized in a way that those who do not have a strong background in analytics are still able to obtain valuable insights.

## Gain Creators

### More Dedicated Resources Towards Retaining Students in the ISA Department
Our solution will give the ISA department the information they need to better plan for the upcoming year by providing estimates of the number of students that will come through the department and eventually graduate each year. This will allow both Dr. Benamati and Dr. Farmer to spend less time on this administrative task and instead on preparing for the longevity of the department.

### Better Classification System to Understand the Ages of Students and When They Are Likely to Graduate
Our solution will provide the ISA department with a better system to classify students by their grade level so they can better understand and predict the number of students who will graduate from the department.
